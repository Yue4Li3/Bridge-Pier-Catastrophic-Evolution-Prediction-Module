# Bridge Pier Catastrophic Evolution Prediction Module

This repository provides a simulation and prediction module for **service-life catastrophic evolution of reinforced concrete bridge piers**.  
The module integrates material durability degradation, nonlinear structural performance evolution, and probabilistic reliability analysis.  
The current release provides documentation, with protected source code available as a ZIP package. An open extractable version will be updated later.

## üìñ Background

Prefabricated and assembled bridge structures have gained popularity due to their short construction periods, high quality control, and reduced environmental impact.  
However, the **connections between prefabricated components** become critical weak points, where long-term durability and degradation processes require special attention.  

Bridge piers, as key load-bearing elements, are particularly vulnerable:  
- Existing performance evaluation models are often oversimplified.  
- Actual service degradation (e.g., chloride ingress, reinforcement corrosion, stiffness reduction) differs significantly from theoretical assumptions.  

This module provides a more realistic prediction of **catastrophic service evolution** by coupling durability degradation, mechanical performance, and reliability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Research Methodology

The framework consists of three main stages:

1. **Mesoscopic Chloride Ingress Simulation**  
   - Simulates chloride penetration into reinforced concrete pier sections over a 100-year service life.  
   - Considers random material composition and mesoscopic variability.  
   - Extracts the **time-dependent state of reinforcement corrosion**.  

2. **Finite Element Analysis with Corrosion Effects**  
   - Incorporates the updated state of corroded reinforcement into an FE model.  
   - Modifies critical material and structural parameters to reflect **non-uniform corrosion**.  
   - Simulates nonlinear structural response under different corrosion stages.  

3. **Probabilistic Life-Cycle Prediction**  
   - Trains an **artificial neural network (ANN)** to rapidly approximate the link between durability degradation and mechanical response.  
   - Performs **Monte Carlo simulations (MCS)** to evaluate probabilistic reliability metrics.
